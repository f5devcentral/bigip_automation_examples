# Overview

The guide demonstrates how BIG-IP application security can be used to validate calls made to application APIs. API schema validation is critical for many traditional and modern apps. Using the **Manual** or **Automated** step, you will configure API schema validation. 

**BIG-IP Service Portal**: the manual UX/UI walk-through done through the BIG-IP service portal
**BIG-IP Automation with Jenkins & Ansible**: following the manual steps, you can extend this scenario with a more advanced updating of API schema scenario when the app itself gets updated.

# Environment & Pre-requisites

## Blueprint Setup _(for F5 employees or customers with access to UDF)_

### 1. Deploy Blueprint

**If you are an F5 employee or customer with access to UDF, you can use the following BIG-IP blueprint flow as the foundation for your environment: "BigIP Automation". Search for this name and utilize the latest version of the blueprint. This GitHub repo is already optimized to work with this UDF blueprint.**

Navigate to the **Blueprints** and search for **BigIP Automation**. Deploy it.

After it has been deployed, navigate to your **Deployments** and start it:

![alt text](./assets/start-depl.png)

### 2. Setup SSH Keys

To enter the Blueprint VM (jumphost), the SSH tool will be used. In order to set up SSH access keys use [this guide](https://help.udf.f5.com/en/articles/3347769-accessing-a-component-via-ssh).

### 3. Enter Blueprint

After the Blueprint has been deployed and SSH keys are setup, navigate to the **Deployments** section and proceed to the **Details** of your deployment. Select the **Components** tab and proceed to the **Ubuntu Jump Host**.

![alt text](./assets/ubuntu-jump-host.png)

Go to the **Access Methods** tab and copy the SSH external. Execute copied command in the command line.

## Docker Compose

**If you are using the UDF Blueprint, you do not need to install Docker since it is already pre-installed there.**

Docker compose is to be installed in this machine. Run the following command to verify if you have it:

```bash
docker compose
```

If the command cannot be executed, you need to install Docker Compose.

## Infrastructure Configuration

### 1. Clone Repository

After that, clone the [repository](https://github.com/f5devcentral/bigip_automation_examples.git). Note that you don't need to specify the SSH keys in Blueprint since they are already specified.

### 2. Run Test App

Proceed to the following directory:

```
cd ~/bigip_automation_examples/bigip/open-api-protection/cicd-environment/server-git/repo/app/automation
```

And run the following command to start the app:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ./playbooks/app-restart-deploy.yml
```

### 3. Setup TMOS Initial Settings

Now that the app is up and running, we need to add it to TMOS. Run the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ./playbooks/tmos_setup.yml --extra-vars 'tmos_user=admin tmos_password=admin'
```

### 4. Verify App

Finally, we will verify the app is up and running. Check the application internal route by running the following command:

```bash
curl http://10.1.10.97/internal/node-info
```

You will see system information in the output.

# Manual Workflow Guide

The manual workflow of this guide showcases protection of API endpoint of an existing app using OpenAPI (Swagger file). We will create a security policy via TMUI and add an OpenAPI file.

## 1. Create Security Policy

In the Blueprint deployed earlier navigate to the **BIG-IP 15.1.x** component and select **TMUI**.

![alt text](./assets/tmui-navigate.png)

Log in with the **admin** & **admin** credentials and navigate to the **Application Security** => **Security Policies**. Click the button to add a policy.

![alt text](./assets/add-sec-policy.png)

In the opened form fill in the required information:

- give policy **app-waf** name
- select the **API Security** template
- upload the swagger file stored in the following directory:

```bash
bigip/open-api-protection/cicd-environment/server-git/repo/app/src/swagger.json
```

- select the created virtual server

![alt text](./assets/policy-config.png)

## 2. Verify Protection

Run the following command:

```bash
curl http://10.1.10.97/internal/node-info
```

You will see the following response without the detailed system information which means that internal routes are now hidden, and only external are available:

```bash
{"supportID": "8211137541852626960"}
```

You can also verify the protection status in TMOS. Navigate to **Application Security** => **URLs**. You will see the list of allowed URLs.

![alt text](./assets/allowed-urls.png)

# Automated Workflow Guide

In this part of the guide we will use CI/CD environment to update the WAF policy with new routes.

## 1. Run CI/CD Environment

First, navigate to the following directory:

```bash
cd ~/bigip_automation_examples/bigip/open-api-protection/cicd-environment
```

And then initialize the environment:

```bash
./init.sh
```

After that, build Docker:

```bash
docker compose build
```

This command will compose Docker for Jenkins, Git SCM, initialize Jenkins with initial parameters for Swagger file to be built and deployed, initialize Git SCM with sources of app that will be built and deployed via CI/CD.

And finally, run CI/CD environment including Git and Jenkins connected to each other:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 2. Connect Jenkins to BIG-IP

Since we do not keep credentials in scripts, we will need to add those to Jenkins.

In the Blueprint deployed earlier navigate to the **Ubuntu Jump Host (client/server)** and proceed to **Firefox**.

**If you are not using the UDF Blueprint, open your browser for the 9090 port on your Jump Host.**

![alt text](./assets/open-firefox.png)

In the opened Firefox tab go to http://10.1.10.4:9090. This will open Jenkins on Jumphost at 9090 port.

In the opened page enter **admin** for both username and password.

![alt text](./assets/jenkins-login.png)

Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Credentials**. Click the **global** button.

![alt text](./assets/jenkins-creds.png)

Click the **Add Credentials** button.

![alt text](./assets/add-creds.png)

Fill in the opened form:

- **admin** for username,
- **admin** for password,
- **bigip-access** for ID.

![alt text](./assets/creds-form.png)

Now Jenkins is setup for running deployment.

## 3. Update Policy

### 3.1 Clone App Repo

Go to the `/tmp` folder in your Ubuntu terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@10.1.1.4:8022/home/git/script-crud-service.git
```

Type in **password** for the requested password.

Enter the `cd script-crud-service` folder and change the branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

### 3.2 Update Routes

Now let's take a look at the structure. In the `routes` you can see two files - `.new` and `.js`. So we will need to rename those - the current one to the `old` for record, and the new one to the current script.

```bash
├── Jenkinsfile
├── automation
│   ├── ansible.cfg
│   ├── filters
│   │   └── make_filename_unique.py
│   ├── inventory.ini
│   ├── library
│   │   └── next_polling_deploy_module.py
│   ├── next_vars.yml
│   ├── playbooks
│   │   ├── app-restart-deploy.yml
│   │   ├── swagger-next.yml
│   │   ├── swagger-tmos.yml
│   │   └── tmos_setup.yml
│   └── tmos_vars.yml
└── src
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── app.js
    ├── models
    │   └── scriptModel.yml
    ├── package.json
    ├── routes
    │   ├── internalRoutes.js
    │   ├── scriptRoutes.js
    │   └── scriptRoutes.new
    ├── swagger.js
    └── swagger.json

7 directories, 20 files
```

Rename the files as follows:

```bash
mv ./src/routes/scriptRoutes.js ./src/routes/scriptRoutes.old
```

and

```bash
mv ./src/routes/scriptRoutes.new ./src/routes/scriptRoutes.js
```

### 3.3 Push Updates

Now that we have a new route, as well as setup CI/CD, we can push these updates to Git SCM:

```bash
git add .
```

Next, describe the commit:

```bash
git commit -m "new routes"
```

If you see the `*** Please tell me who you are.` message, run the following commands with the default user info. However if you want to personalize it, you can use your own information:

```bash
git config --global user.email user@example.com
git config --global user.name "User Name"
```

Finally, run again:

```bash
git commit -m "new routes"
```

and

```bash
git push
```

### 3.4 Review Updates

First, go to Jenkins to see the run pipeline. Enter it and proceed to the **Pipeline Console** showing the job progress.

![alt text](./assets/last-build.png)

Finally, we can verify if Swagger definition is updated via TMOS.

Go back to your deployment and proceed to TMOS. Navigate to **Application Security** => **URLs**. You will see the added `delete` URL.

![alt text](./assets/updated-definition.png)

## 4. Add RateLimiting Feature (New Usecase)

### 4.1 Add the code to the respective folders

First, go to following directory:

```
cd ~/bigip_automation_examples/bigip/open-api-protection/cicd-environment/server-git/repo/app/automation/playbooks
```

Change the file name to the following format:

```bash
mv ratelimit.yml_add ratelimit.yml
```

Also, modify the Jenkinsfile to align with the new usecase changes.

```bash
mv Jenkinsfile.newusecase Jenkinsfile

```
### 4.2 Push the Code

Now that the new feature is in place and CI/CD is set up, it's time to commit and push the changes to Git SCM.

```bash
git add .
```

Next, describe the commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Added Rate Limiting Feature"
```

and

```bash
git push
```

### 3.4 Review Updates

Go to Jenkins and open the latest pipeline run. From there, proceed to the Pipeline Console to view the job execution details.

![alt text](./assets/rate-limit-pp.png)

Finally, we can verify that the configuration is reflected and updated through TMOS.

Go back to your deployment and proceed to TMOS. Navigate to **Local Traffic** => **iRules**. You will see the added `rate limiting iRule` here.

![alt text](./assets/rate-limit-tmos.png)

### 3.4 Test the Usecase

Now, try accessing the endpoint below more than three times to observe how BIG-IP enforces rate limiting to protect it.
