# Module 3: GitOps & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Module 3 explores advanced integration of BIG-IP infrastructure and application services within a GitOps framework (example used if Jenkins, but GitLab or GitHub would perform similarly). 
Learn to use version-controlled repositories, automated CI/CD pipelines, and declarative AS3 configurations to securely deploy and manage BIG-IP services at scale!

## Module Contents

- **[API Schema Validation with Ansible and GitLab CI/CD](./module_3_chapter_2/README.md)**  
  Automate BIG-IP API endpoint protection with OpenAPI schema validation, using GitLab CI/CD and Ansible playbooks.

- **[Infrastructure Configuration with Terraform, Ansible, AS3 and iRules](./module_3_chapter_3/README.md)**  
  Automate AS3 application services and iRules deployment with Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins, integrating them seamlessly into CI/CD workflows.

- **[State Management with Terraform](./module_3_chapter_4/README.md)**  
  Securely manage Terraform state files, establish source-of-truth practices, and adhere to strict lifecycle management principles.
